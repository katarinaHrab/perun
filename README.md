Perun
=====

User and Resource Management System

Perun covers management of the whole ecosystem around the users' identities, groups, resources and services. Perun is well 
suited for managing users whithin organizations and projects, managing access rights to the services. It provides 
functionality to manage all entities (e.g. users, groups, virtual organizations, resources, services) and theirs 
relationships.

As the concept of virtual organization is well established in computational grids, Perun use them as a core unit for user 
management. This concept can be successfully used outside the grid environment due to its nature of defining membership 
restrictions and delegation responsibilities among the members.

Resources are managed separately from the virtual organizations, therefore resource owners can provide theirs resources to the 
several virtual organizations by defining rules under which members of virtual organization can utilize the resources.
